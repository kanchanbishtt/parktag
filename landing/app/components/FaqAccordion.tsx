  {
    q: "How does ParkTag work?",
    a: "You place a QR sticker on your vehicle. When someone scans it with any phone camera, you get notified instantly and can communicate anonymously through the ParkTag platform, without revealing your phone number.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the person scanning need an app?",
    a: "No. The scanner just uses their phone camera, it opens a webpage directly. No app, no sign-up, no friction. Only you (the vehicle owner) use the ParkTag app.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my phone number be shared?",
    a: "Never. Your name, number, and address are never visible to anyone who scans your tag. All contact goes through our anonymous platform.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I lose the sticker?",
    a: "Email us at support@parktag.me. You can deactivate the old tag instantly from the app, and we'll send you a replacement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which vehicles can use ParkTag?",
    a: "Any vehicle: cars, bikes, scooters, EVs, autos, trucks, bicycles. If it parks, it can use ParkTag.",
  },
  {
    // The one thing a buyer is entitled to know before paying and could not
    // find anywhere on this site. Every tag includes a year of masked calling;
    // what happens on day 366 was documented only in the backend.
    //
    // Worth being exact about what lapses, because it is narrower than it
    // sounds and the honest version is the better one: callEntitlement()
    // returns masking:false for a lapsed tag, and masking:false blocks the call
    // — it does not place an unmasked one. The scanner is told "Calling isn't
    // available for this vehicle right now. You can still leave a message."
    // The number is never exposed in any tier, so this answer does not walk
    // back the "Will my phone number be shared? Never." answer above it.
    //
    // No renewal price is quoted because there is no renewal to buy yet: there
    // is no checkout and no billing job behind tag.callSubscription. Naming a
    // figure here would be inventing one.
    q: "What happens after the first year?",
    a: "Every tag includes one year of masked calling. After that, the tag keeps working. Anyone who scans it can still reach you and leave a message, and your number stays private exactly as before. The one thing that pauses is the masked phone call, until you renew. Renewals are not on sale yet; when they are, you will be able to switch calling back on from your dashboard.",
  },
  {
    // The refund policy already covers defects; it was reachable only from a
    // footer link, which is not where somebody weighing up ₹499 is looking.
    q: "What if the tag arrives damaged or faulty?",
    a: "Tell us within 7 days of delivery with an unboxing photo or video and your order ID, and we will replace it. Unused, unscanned tags in their original packaging can also be returned within 7 days. Approved refunds go back to the original payment method in 7–10 business days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does delivery take?",
    // No COD sentence here. It used to quote the ₹50 surcharge, which is real
    // on the signed-in owner shop, but every route this page and the ads lead
    // to is the guest checkout, and that is prepaid only. A visitor reading
    // this answer would arrive at a checkout that cannot honour it.
    a: "Delivery is free on every order, anywhere in India. We ship within 1–2 business days and delivery takes 2–4 business days, with a tracking number once dispatched.",
