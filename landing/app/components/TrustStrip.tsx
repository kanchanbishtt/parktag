// The trust bar under the hero: four reassurances, each a claim plus the line
// that backs it, on one navy plate.
//
// Commerce terms, deliberately not product properties. The hero already carries
// "no app required / easy installation / no number sharing" directly under its
// sub-line, and a strip repeating those a screen later is the duplication this
// page has too much of already. These four answer the other question a stranger
// has — what happens after I pay — and every one is checkable in the checkout:
// delivery is free on all orders, COD exists with a Rs 50 surcharge, every tag
// ships with a year of Premium, and the refund policy is 7 days.
//
// "Made in India", which the reference strip carries, is deliberately absent.
// It is a manufacturing claim and nothing in this repo establishes it, so it
// would be the one line here that a buyer could not verify.
// Cash on delivery is deliberately absent, for the same reason "Made in India"
// is: it is a claim a buyer could act on and we would not honour. The only
// checkout an ad or this page sends anyone to is the guest one, and that is
// prepaid. Restore the line only alongside a guest COD route.
