//
// These five pages need neither. None contains an inline <script> (the two that

// because unlike the dashboard this page builds nothing with onclick.
//

// no longer runs. The second is not, so script-src-attr keeps 'unsafe-inline' —
// injecting into an attribute context still works, which is a narrower hole than
// the one being closed but is not nothing. Converting those handlers is a real

    // instead, restoring per-visitor rate limiting.
    //
    // Use `1` (trust exactly one proxy hop), NOT `true`. `true` trusts the
    // ENTIRE forwarded chain, so an attacker can prepend a spoofed
    // `X-Forwarded-For` and get a brand-new `request.ip` — hence a fresh
    // rate-limit bucket — on every request, defeating the 5/min login/OTP
    // limits and the plate last-4 lockout. `1` trusts only the single reverse
    // proxy actually in front of the app (Railway's edge), so `request.ip` is
    // the IP that proxy observed and any client-supplied XFF entries are
    // ignored. If the deployment ever gains another proxy hop (e.g. a CDN in
    // front of Railway), bump this to match the real number of trusted hops.
    // ONE hop, expressed as a predicate rather than the number 1.
    //
    // `trustProxy: 1` meant this and read better, but fastify 5.12.3 — the
    // release that fixes GHSA-3m5p-2c4r-xxw2, the X-Forwarded-* spoof this
    // setting exists to prevent — changed what a NUMBER means. On that version
    // `1` stops trusting the proxy at all: request.ip becomes the address of
    // Railway's edge for every caller and request.protocol falls back to
    // "http". That is worse than the bug being fixed. Every per-IP limit
    // collapses into a single shared bucket, so one abuser rate-limits the
    // entire userbase, and the spray lockout keys on one address for everyone.
    //
    // The predicate form is unchanged by the patch and says exactly what was
    // meant: the immediate peer (hop 0) is our reverse proxy and nothing beyond
    // it is trusted. `true` also restores the client IP but trusts the WHOLE
    // chain, which hands the spoof straight back — a caller who prepends
    // "X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4" is believed. Verified against a real socket on
    // both versions: with `1.2.3.4, <real client>` this yields the real client,
    // while `true` yields 1.2.3.4.
    //
    // Address-agnostic on purpose. An allowlist ("loopback", a subnet) works
    // too, but only while Railway's edge keeps the address we wrote down.
    //
    // That "if the deployment ever gains another proxy hop" happened. Railway
    // now puts two of its own machines in front of this process, so one hop
    // stopped on a Railway edge address instead of the caller: activity rows
    // told owners every scan came from Singapore (the sin1 PoP), and every
    // per-IP limit collapsed into one bucket per PoP.
    //
    // The replacement recognises our own infrastructure and stops at the first
    // address that is not ours, so it survives Railway adding or removing a
    // layer instead of silently mis-reporting again. It is still capped, so it
    // can never walk off the end of the chain into caller-controlled values.

  // creating the session. Land one on a victim's browser and they are quietly
  // signed in as the attacker, and everything they do next — an address, a
  // vehicle, a document — is filed under the attacker's account.
  //
  // Origin is the check. A browser attaches it to every cross-origin POST and
  // scripts cannot forge it. Referer is the fallback for the rare browser that
  // omits Origin on same-origin requests.
  //
  // Neither header present means the caller is not a browser — curl, the verify
  // scripts, a server-to-server call — and is allowed through: those requests
  // are not the ones an attacker can make a victim's browser send. Blocking
  // them would break the operational scripts while stopping no attack.
  //
  // WHAT IS COVERED. Every prefix below is a browser-driven surface whose
  // requests are authorised by a cookie, which is precisely the shape a forged
  // cross-site request exploits. It started at /api/auth/* alone, which left
  // every signed-in action — change a tag's status, rewrite an emergency
  // contact, delete a vehicle, delete the account — with no origin check at
  // all. SameSite=Lax covers most of that in a current browser by withholding
  // the cookie, but Lax is same-SITE: a foothold on any parktag.me subdomain
  // is same-site and keeps the cookie. This is the control that does not have
  // that gap.
  //
  // WHAT IS NOT, and must not be. The Exotel and Meta webhooks under
  // /api/provider/* are cross-origin POSTs by design and authenticate with
  // their own secrets, so an origin check would reject every one of them. The
  // public scan, shop and contact surfaces are left out for the same reason —
  // they are reachable without a session, so there is no ambient authority to
  // forge, and a payment provider may post to them from its own origin.
  //
  // Unsafe methods only. GET is excluded because it is not supposed to change
  // state, and sweeping it in would block ordinary cross-site navigation.
  // /api/shop/ was left out when this list was widened, on the assumption that a
  // payment provider might post to it. It does not: there is no Razorpay webhook
  // route in this app, and every /api/shop/* route is a fetch from our own
  // checkout. That left the money routes — place a COD order, start a payment,

  // into a Location header and an unvalidated pack id there is a header
  // injection; serving a file echoes nothing, so the whole question goes away.
  // A sku in the query is now simply ignored.
