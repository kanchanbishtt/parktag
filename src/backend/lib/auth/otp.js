// evidence of ownership. On legacy records it is an unverified free-text claim
// — someone could have typed a stranger's number at signup — so adopting one
// that still has a password or a linked Google account would hand the person
// holding the OTP an account that somebody else can also sign into (and vice
// versa). Hence three outcomes:
//

//                in. Neither forking a duplicate nor silently adopting is
//                right; the caller tells the user to sign in the way they

//                the OTP-gated POST /api/owner/mobile is for.
