// Turning a paid membership order into time on a tag.
//
// Shared by the two paths that can report a payment, exactly like
// fulfilPaidOrder is for the shop: POST /api/owner/membership/verify-payment,
// called by the buyer's browser, and the Razorpay webhook, which does not
// depend on the buyer's device surviving the redirect. Whichever arrives first
// does the work and the other is a no-op — a lesson this codebase learned the
// expensive way, with a webhook that was never configured and orders that sat
// unfulfilled because the tab closed.
//
// ONE TAG, ONE SUBSCRIPTION. subscription.js is the only thing that decides
// whether a tag is entitled, and it reads `tag.subscription`. That is the field
// written here. The two legacy names it also reads — callSubscription and
// documentSubscription — are deliberately NOT written: they exist so tags
// stamped before that module was unified keep working, and writing a third
// copy of the same fact is how they came to disagree in the first place.
