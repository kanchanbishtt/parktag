// What happens once an online order is actually paid for.
//
// This used to live inline in POST /api/shop/verify-payment, which meant the
// ONLY thing that could ever mark an order paid was the buyer's browser making
// one more HTTP call from the Razorpay success handler. Close the tab, lose
// signal, or let the phone sleep in the second between Razorpay capturing the
// money and that call going out, and the payment succeeded while the order sat
// at "created" forever: no tag minted, no shipment booked, no confirmation
// sent, and nothing server-side aware that anything was owed. The customer had
// paid and had nothing.
//
// Extracted here so the Razorpay webhook can run exactly the same steps. Two
// independent paths now lead to fulfilment — the browser callback and the
// provider's server-to-server notification — and whichever arrives first does
// the work.
//
// SAFE TO RUN TWICE. The created → paid flip is a single conditional update, so
// only one caller can ever observe `firstTime`; everything with a side effect
// hangs off that. A webhook retry, a duplicate callback, or both racing each
// other cannot mint two tags or book two shipments.
