// ── Private document vault ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Owners keep soft copies of their vehicle paperwork here — RC, insurance, PUC,
// driving licence — so they are reachable at a police stop or after an accident
// without digging through the glovebox.
//
// OWNER-ONLY, deliberately. Nothing in this module is reachable from a tag
// scan: every route that uses it sits behind an owner session AND a re-entered
// PIN. Someone who scans a parked car's QR gets the existing masked-contact
// flow and no hint that documents exist at all. That is the whole security
// model — a scannable document store would turn a parking tag into a way to
// harvest identity documents off any car in a car park.
//
// The PIN is a SECOND factor over the login session, not a password: the threat
// it answers is an unlocked, unattended phone that is already signed in. It is
// short by design, so the brute-force defence is the lockout below rather than
// the digit count.

//

//                                           free vehicles cannot fill GridFS.
//   Premium tag              3 documents  — RC, insurance and PUC, which is the
//                                           set an owner is actually asked for.

//                                           for it.
//   Premium + subscription   the lot      — the paid add-on. See
//                                           hasActiveDocumentSubscription: the
//                                           entitlement is read here, but

// does not hold: a security pass sent 12 concurrent uploads at a 6-per-vehicle
// cap and stored 12, and 15 concurrent 4MB uploads at a 40MB per-owner cap and
// stored 60MB. Every request read the same pre-write state, and every request
// was genuinely under the limit at the moment it looked. The rate limiter does
// not save it either — 20 uploads per 5 minutes is 100MB against a 40MB cap
// even served strictly one at a time.
//
// Re-counting after the insert does not fix this. Whichever way it is phrased,
// a count can miss a concurrent insert that has not landed yet, so it can still
// admit more than the cap allows.
//
// What does hold is a single-document conditional update. MongoDB applies one
// update to one document atomically, so making the LIMIT part of the update's
// filter means the increment happens if and only if there is room, with no gap
// for a second request to slip through. `vault_usage` holds one row per owner —
// total bytes, plus a document count per vehicle — and every upload has to win
// that update before its record is written.
//

// any order and still arrive at the same total. A recompute racing an insert
// would lose it.

// both compute the same pre-existing truth.
//
// This is also the RECOVERY path, and the reason there is no reconciliation on
// the request path. Documents removed out of band — a manual cleanup, a
// migration, anything that does not go through releaseStorage — leave the
// counter reading high, and the owner quietly loses storage they are entitled
// to. The repair is to delete that owner's `vault_usage` row: the next upload
// finds it missing and rebuilds it from the documents that actually exist.

//
//   • Deleting a VEHICLE soft-deletes its tag. ownedTag() then refuses the tag,
//     so the owner could no longer list or delete the documents filed under it
//     — but the rows and the GridFS bytes stayed, unreachable and permanent,
//     still counted against the owner's storage quota.
//   • Deleting an ACCOUNT wiped tags, contact requests, orders, addresses and
//     pending calls, and left the vault untouched. An RC, a driving licence and
//     an insurance policy therefore SURVIVED the account they belonged to, with
//     no sweeper anywhere to collect them. For an erasure request under the
//     DPDP Act that is precisely the data that must not be retained.
//
// Both paths now come through here. Metadata is removed FIRST, for the same
// reason the single-document route does it in that order: if the bucket delete
// then fails, what is left behind is an orphaned blob to sweep rather than a
// listed document whose bytes have already vanished.
//
