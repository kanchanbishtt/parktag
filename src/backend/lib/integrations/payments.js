// later, retyping it by hand put the final character in the wrong case. Both
// are still non-empty strings, so `isRazorpayConfigured` was true, boot was
// clean, health checks were green — and the only symptom was a customer being
// told to try again, five weeks of them, while COD orders kept arriving and
// made the silence look normal.
//
// A read-only GET is enough to settle it: it exercises the same Basic auth
// header order creation uses, so it catches a bad id, a bad secret, whitespace,
// and a case typo alike. It creates nothing.
//
// Deliberately NOT fatal. A payment API that is briefly unreachable must not
// stop the site from serving the pages that have nothing to do with payment —
// and a hard exit on a network blip would be a self-inflicted outage on every
// deploy. The point is to make the failure loud and immediate, not to trade one
// silent outage for a noisier one.
