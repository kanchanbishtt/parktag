    // happen to own one — otherwise a single premium purchase would quietly
    // unlock callback for every E-Tag on the account.

    // Deleted tags are excluded so that this agrees with the dashboard, which
    // builds its own tag list the same way. A button the page draws and a route
    // that refuses it is worse than either answer on its own.

    // availability check and register-call cannot disagree about the same tag.

    // The extra fields are projected because the entitlement needs them; a
    // token-only projection would make every tag look like it had no trial and
    // no subscription, which reads as lapsed and would switch callback off for
    // everyone. `activatedAt` is on that list for the same reason: leave it out
    // and a retail tag falls back to its print date here while every other
