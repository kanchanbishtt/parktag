// What the membership screen renders, and the checkout behind it.
//
// The page computes nothing: no prices, no savings, no trial length, and above
// all no amount. The browser sends a plan id; the server resolves what that
// costs. A price the browser can author is a price the browser can change, and
// that is the whole reason SHOP_PRODUCTS lives on this side too.
//
// ONE-TIME PREPAID, NOT A RECURRING MANDATE. The plans are fixed terms at fixed
// prices — ₹49 for a month, ₹149 for six, ₹249 for twelve — so a purchase buys
// a block of time and extends the tag's period. Razorpay Subscriptions would
// mean plan entities, an eMandate or UPI Autopay mandate signed by the customer
// and enabled on the account, and a renewal lifecycle with its own failure
// states. None of that is needed to sell a fixed term, and a mandate the buyer
// has to authorise is a harder sell than a single payment. Auto-renew is a
// deliberate follow-up, not an oversight.

// Which tag the membership applies to.
//
// The entitlement model is per tag — subscription.js reads tag.subscription and
// nothing else — so a purchase has to name one. Owners today hold exactly one
// claimed tag each, so asking would be a question with one possible answer, and
// this resolves it silently in that case. With several, the caller must say
// which: guessing would put a year of premium on whichever tag happened to sort
// first, and the owner would have no idea until they looked.
