// and `request.ip` becomes client-settable again, too low and every visitor
// shares one bucket. Because this single check is what stands between a
// stranger and a masked call, the owner's SOS contact, and the plate, it must
// not rest on one integer staying correct through future infra changes (a CDN
// added in front of Railway would change that hop count).
//
// So we ALSO cap failures per tag across every IP. No header, proxy topology,
// or address rotation can widen this bucket — the tag token is the key, and the
// attacker is by definition brute-forcing one specific tag.
//
// Sizing is deliberately generous: a legitimate finder is standing at the
// vehicle reading the plate off it, so genuine failures are near zero. 30
// failures/hour still reduces an exhaustive search of the 10,000-combination
// space to ~14 days per tag, while making an accidental lockout of a real

// then ring it by scanning their own tag.
//
// The number stays un-OTP'd on purpose — demanding a code from the next of kin
// would make the feature unusable in the case it exists for. Bound the abuse
// instead: a hard per-tag daily ceiling, plus an ownerId on every SOS record so

// route was silently gone with no way back but re-scanning A. Exotel only tells
// us the caller's number, never which sticker they scanned, so the webhook
// cannot disambiguate — but leaving each vehicle's row intact means a second

// The number a masked call rings back on is taken on trust: a finder standing
// at a vehicle has no way to prove a number, and demanding a code before they
// can report a blocked driveway would break the feature in the situation it
// exists for. Exotel then tells the Dial Whom webhook nothing about an incoming
// call except the number it came from, so that number is the whole of the
// routing key — and whoever registered it last decides where the call lands.
//
// That is enough for a stranger who knows someone's mobile number: register it
// against a tag of their own, wait for that person to dial the virtual number,
// and take a call the caller believes is going to a vehicle's owner.
//
// The registrant cannot be identified, but it can be distinguished. A genuine
// second registration for a number comes from the handset that made the first
// one — scan car A then car B, or try the owner and then Emergency — while a
// planted one does not. So a live route registered from a different client
// makes this registration a contest, and the contest is settled in favour of
// whoever got there first: the handset already holding the number keeps its
// route, and the stranger gets a refusal instead of the newest-wins victory
// they were counting on.
//
// Deliberately NOT the other way round. By the time a contest arrives the
// incumbent has already spent the tag's one free contact, so retiring their
// route would leave them unable to register another one (402 FREE_USED) — and
// anyone could then permanently silence an E-Tag by registering its finder's
// number a second time. Refusing the newcomer costs a genuine newcomer nothing
// but a retry, because this runs before anything is written.
//
// Residual, stated plainly: a number planted BEFORE its real holder registers
// anything is the only live route for that number, so someone who dials the
// virtual number from their call history rather than through the page can still
// be misrouted until the row expires. Closing that needs a caller number the
// server can actually prove — an OTP on the finder, or a per-registration
// virtual number from Exotel — neither of which is a change this endpoint can
