// The landing site (parktag.me) and this API (app.parktag.me) are SEPARATE
// Railway services, so a beacon arriving here has the landing server as its
// socket peer — `request.ip` is our own infrastructure, not the visitor. The
// visitor's address therefore has to be forwarded in the body, and the shared
// secret below is what makes that forwarded value trustworthy: without it,
// anyone could POST arbitrary addresses and invent traffic from anywhere.
//
// WHAT IS PERSISTED, AND WHAT IS NOT:
// The IP is resolved to a country/region/city and then discarded — no address
// is written to the database, and neither is the raw User-Agent. Repeat views
// are collapsed with `visitorHash`, a salted digest of (IP + UA + IST date)
// that ROTATES DAILY and is one-way, so it separates "20 people from Delhi"
// from "one person reloading 20 times" without creating an identifier that can
// follow anyone from one day to the next. There is no cookie and no client-side
// storage, which is also why this needs no consent banner.
