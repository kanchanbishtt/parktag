// Razorpay's server-to-server notification that a payment succeeded.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now the only thing that could mark an order paid was
// POST /api/shop/verify-payment, called by the buyer's browser from Razorpay's
// success handler. That makes fulfilment depend on the customer's device
// staying alive and online for one more request after their money has already
// left. Close the tab on the confirmation, walk into a lift, let the phone
// sleep — Razorpay captured the payment and this app never heard about it. The
// order sat at "created": no tag minted, no shipment booked, no confirmation
// e-mail, and nothing server-side aware that anything was owed. Returning to
// checkout then offered to charge them again.
//
// Razorpay retries this callback, so it closes that window without depending on
// the customer at all.
//
// AUTHENTICATION. The body is signed with the WEBHOOK secret — a different
// secret from the API key secret used for checkout signatures, configured
// alongside the endpoint in the Razorpay dashboard. It is an HMAC-SHA256 over
// the exact bytes received, which is why this reads `request.rawBody` (stashed
// by the JSON parser in app.js) rather than re-serialising the parsed object:
// key order and whitespace would not survive a round trip and the digest would
// not match.
//
// Without that check this endpoint would be a way for anyone who finds the URL
// to mark arbitrary orders paid and have real stock shipped for free, so it
// fails CLOSED — no secret configured means no webhook is accepted.
