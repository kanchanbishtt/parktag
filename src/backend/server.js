// Ordering matters, and it was backwards: Mongo was closed BEFORE the HTTP
// server, so every request still in flight when the platform sent SIGTERM lost
// its database mid-handler and failed. Railway sends SIGTERM on every deploy,
// so that was a burst of 500s on each release. `app.close()` stops accepting
// new connections and waits for in-flight requests to finish; only once they
// are done is it safe to drop the connection they depend on.

// so an unhandled rejection here would terminate the process before the drain
// completed — turning a graceful shutdown back into an abrupt one.
