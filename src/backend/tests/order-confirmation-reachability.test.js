// A guest order has no account behind it and the /get form collects no e-mail,
// so the confirmation carrying the order number is a WhatsApp to the delivery
// phone. When Meta is not configured that message is never sent, and this
// function used to fall out of its own bottom in silence: the order was paid,
// the tag was minted, the parcel shipped, and nobody had told the buyer
// anything. If they had closed the tab during payment they had never seen the
// order number either, so they could not even look it up.
//
// Nothing about that looked wrong from the server. It surfaced as a support
// ticket, which is the same shape of silent loss the Razorpay webhook secret
// had. So the last branch is an ERROR naming the order and the reason.
//
// Deliberately NOT a database test. Every branch here is decided by the
// arguments, and the collections are reduced to the single lookup this makes —
// which keeps the case that matters (nobody is reachable) runnable on any
// machine, including one whose cluster is full.

// Before the module is imported: a developer .env points at the LIVE Meta
// account, and the WhatsApp branch below would message whoever really owns the
// number in the fixture. Blanked here so that branch is unreachable, and
// asserted in the suite rather than assumed.
