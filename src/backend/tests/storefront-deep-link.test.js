// The public shop, and the pack id that travels with it.
//
// /shop serves the storefront to a signed-out visitor, prices, packs and a
// guest checkout, no login. It used to redirect to /owner-login, which is the
// wall docs/SHOP_LOGIN_WALL.md describes, and these tests pin that it no longer
// does.
//
// /get is where the storefront lived first, and it is a page again rather than
// a redirect into /shop. Nothing links to it by design, so these tests are the
// only thing that would notice it breaking.
//
// It used to forward ?sku into a Location header, which is why there was a row
// of header-injection cases here. Serving a file echoes nothing back, so that
// surface is gone rather than guarded — what is left is the assertion that says
// so: whatever goes into the query, none of it reaches the page.
