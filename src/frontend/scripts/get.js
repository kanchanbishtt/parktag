//
// That split is the whole design. Prices are already written down in three
// places in this repo and have drifted apart once already; a storefront that
// quotes a figure the checkout does not charge is the worst place for it to
// happen again, because it is the first thing a stranger reads.
//
// So no amount anybody is CHARGED appears in this file. The one exception is
// `orig` below — the struck-through "was" price, which is a marketing claim
// rather than anything billed, and which is only rendered when it is genuinely
// above the price being charged.

// Display-only. `orig` is the struck-through "was" price, which is marketing
// copy rather than anything charged, so it belongs on this side.
